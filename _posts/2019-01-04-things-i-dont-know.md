I don't generally care for blogging. This post is inspired by something Dan Abramov [wrote](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/). My intention is to take stock of cool technologies that I either don't know about at all or that I'd like to learn more deeply. This one isn't based on technologies that people think that I know, just stuff that I'd like to learn more about but I don't understand. Enough with this rambling! On to the list.

1. **C/C++** - I've seen some code written in these languages but I've never taken the time to understand either of them. I think it would be worthwhile to get a deeper understanding of memory management.
2. **Design Patterns** - Frankly I just haven't really used them very much. I can name and describe some central ones (Factory, IoC/DI). If someone came up to me and asked "Hey Chris I want to design this tool how should I do it?" I wouldn't be able to anchor my decisions to patterns without looking them out.
3. **Machine Learning** - I'm not seriously excited by machine learning. My impression is that what a lot of people do with machine learning basically chalks up to plumbing. However, I do see its utility and how deeply it's penetrated the tech industry. From that perspective I think I should be able to at least set up tensors to get piped into a model, even if I don't understand the models in depth
4. **Data Science** - Related to ML. I have a math degree that I don't really use anymore, but I really enjoy math. Getting back into statistics and understanding 'big data' and cleaning up data sets seems useful.

Anyways that's about it for my rambling for now. There are a lot of other topics I don't understand, but these are the 4 that come to mind right now.
